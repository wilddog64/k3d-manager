## Known Bugs / Gaps

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Missing Secrets/ConfigMaps on Ubuntu k3s | OPEN | `CreateContainerConfigError` + `CrashLoopBackOff` on all 5 services; ESO not configured for app namespaces; see `docs/issues/2026-03-18-shopping-cart-missing-secrets-configmaps.md` |
| SSH Tunnel timeouts | OPEN | Frequent connection resets during heavy ArgoCD sync; requires `ServerAliveInterval` or `screen` for stability |
| ArgoCD cluster registration over tunnel | FIXED | Using manual cluster secret pointing to `https://host.k3d.internal:6443` with `insecure: true` |
| Vault Kubernetes auth over tunnel | KNOWN | CA cert validation fails over SSH tunnel; use static Vault token with `eso-reader` policy as fallback |
