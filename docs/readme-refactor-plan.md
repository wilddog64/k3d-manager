## README Slimming Plan

1. Capture quick-start essentials for k3d-manager users in the main `README.md` (command overview, Jenkins deploy synopsis, key environment prerequisites).
2. Move detailed provider, Jenkins, and LastPass walkthroughs into focused docs under `docs/` (one page per topic with stable anchors).
3. Update the README to link prominently to the new docs so advanced workflows remain discoverable.
